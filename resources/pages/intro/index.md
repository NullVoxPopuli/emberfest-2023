<!-- 
This presentation has a lot of links,
and is written to still be useful and 
have all the context when uploaded and read.

However, when live, links aren't very helpful.

Allllmost all links will will be represented by QR Codes.

Most of what I'll be linking to is documentation and live demos.



QR Codes can get a little squirrely, 
but I did test this with one of the more complicated QR codes in here.

!! click, and then click play on the video

soooo... since we all just got back from lunch, some of ya'll may have food-induced sleepiness.

and since some QR codes may be hard to scan from the back of the room (like the one in the video here)

I encourage and welcome folks to stand up, shift around, 

get closer to the screens 
 while I'm talking about things.


If you're watching live online, you also may want to have your phone out

Though, the QR Codes are supplemental information, so no one needs to feel like they are missing out by not scanning the QR Codes.


The slides will be available on GitHub, 
and published to and viewable from github pages, 
if you want to wait until later to scan / click the QR Codes as well.
